							<h3>Components</h3>
							<hr />
							<section>
								<h4>Initial Concepts</h4>
								<p>We initially debated three design options. The first was a fixed delivery system,
									with a servo operated side-selector which released balls to either side, depending
									on which side of the board the bot was on:</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The second option rotated to position the chute over the basket before releasing the
									payload:</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The third was a projectile system which shot the balls into the basket:</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<hr />
								<h4>Final Concept</h4>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload4.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>We wanted a simple payload delivery system with minimal operating parts, so early on
									we selected design option 1. This design also simplified programming by eliminating
									the need to turn the bot to face the shooting zone, or rotate the payload delivery
									chute. The delivery side is determined by the bot during its initial orientation in
									the start zone. When it arrives at the shooting zone, a servo activates, moving the
									selector to open a path to the appropriate delivery chute, allowing the balls to
									fall into the basket.

							<h3>Design Evolution</h3>
							<p>Early designs were based on a fully 3d printed construction. However, the size, mass, and
								print times proved impractical so other options were sought. We sourced inexpensive 2”
								diameter tubing to serve as the hopper and delivery chutes, and only used 3d printed
								parts for the connections.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<section>
								<h4>Mounting Plate</h4>
								<p>The first design for the mount which connects and supports the tubes was unreliable.
									So, we redesigned the parts to make the deployment angles more aggressive, which
									improved offloads. </p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The final mounting plate, shown on the right, included improvements in weight and
									size, and added a slope to the delivery chute mounts to improve offload consistency
									from earlier designs (left).
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Tube Supports</h4>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload6.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Tube supports evolved to include a 20 degree backward sweep, and a 10 degree downward
									sweep to align balls with the center of the basket.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Side-Selector</h4>
								<p>The selector proved to be a considerable design challenge. The textured surface of
									the balls has a very high coefficient of friction, so the balls would jam in the
									chutes. The horizontal design, shown on the left side of the image below, did not
									allow the balls to fall far enough to develop the energy necessary to overcome that
									friction force. To correct this, we designed a vertically oriented selector which
									held the balls higher, allowing them to fall farther before being directed left or
									right. Then, we adapted the design to provide the smoothest transition from the
									hopper to the deployment chute, eventually landing on the design seen on the right
									side of the image below.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload7.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The horizontal model did not allow ball to accelerate enough to overcome the friction
									of the ball’s suede-like texture. The final version has a radius that matches the
									curve between the hopper and the delivery chute. </p>
							</section>
							<hr />
							<h3>Controls</h3>
							<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload9.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<p>The payload deployment system is controlled by a single servo. While it is a simple
								operation, two issues arose during testing. </p>
							<section>
								<h4>Problem 1: Servo Oscillation</h4>
								<p>Because the servo is powered directly from our 5V DC bus, it powers on before the
									Arduino Uno used to control its PWM inputs. This meant that when the bot was powered
									on, the servo would oscillate until the Arduino powered on and fixed its position,
									sometimes up to 20°. This would often cause the selector to jam against the first
									ball, preventing deployment, and stressing the servo.
								</p>
								<p>Apparently, this is a common problem, and research pointed us to a quick solution. By
									adding a 10K ohm resistor between the PWM and the +5V connectors, the servo position
									is essentially fixed during power up, correcting the problem. A diagram of the
									solution is shown below.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload10.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<h4>Problem 2: Ball Jamming</h4>
								<p>The second problem was that the balls would sometimes jam against the selector during
									deployment. This was attributed to two factors. First, there is a high coefficient
									of friction between the selector and the ball. This was mitigated by the use of
									low-friction tape, as seen in the image below.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload11.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Second, the lateral orientation of the balls in the hopper, which is random based on
									how they fall while being loaded, could lead to jamming. The solution was to code in
									a “kick” to one side, prior to rotating into its final deployed position. This
									“kick” ensured the balls were oriented properly before the selector was positioned
									for deployment. The sequence can be seen in the image below. </p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/payload12.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>This realignment sequence did help with deployment consistency, and we were able to
									obtain a >90% deployment reliability. However, challenges with code implementation
									meant that we were not able to fully overcome the geometric problems with our
									design.
								</p>
								<p>On reflection, we could have refined the relative positioning of the hopper and
									deployment tubes to eliminate the need for the “kick”. By increasing the distance
									between the hopper and deployment tubes, the diameter for the tangent circle
									connecting the tubes would have increased, improving the angle of incidence of the
									balls on the selector, and reducing energy losses due to impact and friction.
									However, overall, the payload delivery system proved adequately reliable, fast to
									offload (under 2 seconds), and incredibly fast to reload (<1 second). </p>
