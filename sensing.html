								<h4>Sensor Setup</h4>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sensing1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>The four TF-Luna sensors each communicated with the Arduino via either UART or I2C.
									Because we used four identical units, we determined that communication would be
									simplest via I2C, and deconflicted our sensor network by modifying the I2C addresses
									of each TF-Luna used. </p>
								<h4>Gameplay</h4>
								<p>Because of our sensor setup, we were able to utilize coordinates alone to navigate
									the course and reach landmarks. The robot followed a small set of instructions to
									reach each coordinate and complete each task, relying on distance measurements to
									identify its position along each component of the trajectory between landmarks. For
									simplicity, it was determined that each component would be limited to pure forward,
									reverse, left, or right movement, enabled by our usage of mecanum wheels allowing
									for rotation-free translation.

							<h3>High-Level and Design Considerations</h3>
							<p>Our primary consideration in choosing sensors was to select a sensor set which would
								allow us to navigate the board using as few inputs as possible. This meant that,
								ideally, our sensor set would use a single method - such as rangefinding - everywhere on
								the board for positioning and navigation.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<section>
								<h4>Sensor Choice</h4>
								<p>Our sensing objective was to approximate the position of the robot based on a minimal
									set of distance measurements, taken at a relatively low sampling rate (whose lower
									bound would be determined from the precise speed measurements afforded by our
									stepper motors). We determined quickly that IR rangefinders and short/medium
									distance LiDAR rangefinders would allow us sufficiently accurate distance measuring,
									while also requiring minimal compute.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chart.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>Anticipating significant vibrations from the rough-surface mecanum wheels, we removed
									the relatively noisy IR sensors from consideration. Our final sensor decision was
									determined by the relative performance of our two LiDAR sensors, the VL53L0X and
									TF-Luna, shown above. As our maximal required distance measurement on the board was
									above the VL53L0Xâ€™s measurement threshold, causing significant error at larger
									distances, we opted to use TF-Luna LiDAR sensors on the robot, with corrections for
									low-distance error incorporated into sensor-chassis integration and code.
								</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Sensor Configuration</h4>
								<p>With accurate distance measurements as our only mode of positioning and control, our
									robot required a sensor configuration capable of resolving both 1. Coordinate point
									position on the board, and 2. Robot orientation on the board. Coordinate point
									position resolution was simple, as the TF-Luna LiDAR sensors were accurate at almost
									all distances on the board to approximately 3cm. </p>
								<p>Orientation was slightly more complex. Initially, we determined that our minimal
									sensing configuration would require six sensors, such that orientation on the board
									could be resolved by comparing readings from forward and rear sensors on either the
									port or the starboard side of the robot. This way, when the port or starboard
									readings were equivalent at front and rear, the robot would determine that it is
									oriented wall-normal, which we could use for navigation.
								</p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/sensing8.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>However, we later determined that we could resolve robot orientation more accurately
									through the more rudimentary method of coordinate estimation on a known map followed
									by wall collision. This required just four sensors, as, assuming that each sensor
									was accurate to a minute tolerance with appropriate calibration and low-range
									handling, our minimal coordinate system required four distance measurements: front,
									rear, left, and right. Ultimately, each sensor was placed at the center of each side
									of the robot, and inset by approximately 5cm to mitigate TF-Luna inaccuracy at short
									distances. </p>
