							<h3>Evolution of Chassis Design</h3>
							<hr />
							<section>
								<h4>Initial Concept</h4>
								<p>The initial design was smaller, designed for
									smaller mecanum wheels and without room for tight sensor integration. </p>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chassis1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chassis2x.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<hr />
								<h4>Final Concept</h4>
								<p>The final concept was larger, including space for four inset LiDAR sensors and space
									for lie-flat batteries, and was even more tightly integrated than the initial
									design. The density of components in
									the chassis, while cool, was not really necessary. Granted, it gave us more margin
									for error when traversing the gap, but the increase in fiddlyness was likely not
									worth it.

							<h3>High-Level Design</h3>
							<p>At its core, our design aims to create a robust hardware platform that performs as
								expected, so no unnecessary complexity is created in code. Our motor and wheel choices
								reflect this ethos. Specifically, our drivetrain consists of four independently stepper
								driven mecanum wheels.
							</p>
							<hr />
							<section>
								<h4>Motors and Wheels</h4>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chassis3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>While this initially might seem like a strange choice, given stepper motors’ lower
									torque and high power requirements, it really played in our favor. Firstly, since we
									were using four wheel drive, torque was not at all an issue and we easily were able
									to make it up the ramp at speed. But the big selling point of steppers is their
									reliable control. Since you are commanding steps per second, you can be confident
									that all your motors will spin at the same speed, regardless of battery charge. This
									meant that we didn't have to implement any control logic that dealt with drift,
									compensated for battery charge, and we could use the mecanums so reliably that we
									never had to worry about steering. All our motion was lateral translation. The only
									issue that came up was that steppers do not have closed loop control, this was only
									a problem since we didn't have time to implement acceleration, commanding a step
									change in speed sometime meant we lost a couple of steps, which caused the bot to
									turn a couple of degrees upon acceleration and deceleration. </p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<h4>Chassis</h4>
								<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/chassis5.jpg" alt="" /></a>
								<p>As for the chassis, the entire thing was quite tightly integrated and fully 3D
									printed. I would highly recommend the latter – while laser cutting seems attractive,
									it is very easy to design robust single components for 3D printing, with geometries
									that are hard to accomplish with the laser. Also, iteration time is faster (the
									printer does all the work) and you don’t have to deal with finger joints and the
									slop that comes with them. Moreover, not a single part we printed was printed with
									supports, I would highly recommend putting in the design work to make this happen,
									as it reduces print and iteration time. The printer can also be pushed beyond what
									the slicer tells you is possible.</p>
